From my last blog entry, I stated that I wanted to create a general layout for my platformer game. I have done that relatively well however there were a few things that I didn't get a chance to work on just yet and for good reason. One thing I wanted to work on from my last entry was getting my own sprites for my game however I was so focused on creating my general layout that I forgot to complete that task.

After some time and effort I ended up having the image show below as my first draft of my layout,

<img width="364" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-02 at 11 02 07â€¯PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1002cc7a-ff2f-48e4-9bfb-4320c01b65aa" />

Honestly, I am very satisfied with how the layout turned out. The way I made this was I first had to think about the design. I knew that if I made the different levels too lengthy horizontally, the game would become pretty confusing for the player because the camera is zoomed in on the character so it would become difficult for the player to navigate. So to prevent this issue from happening I added walls to the levels and the way I did that was I realized that objects with the platform behavior, the player could jump and run on top of the object but when the player would come into contact with the object horizontally, they couldn't progress. 

So 

1) I added objects
2) added the platform behavior to them
3) increased the size of them
4) Added the sides of the objects to act as the walls for the game

So now the game has its walls.

Now the next step would be to add the different levels. I was sitting with my friend and I asked him what level themes should I include. He said to think about things that I like, so I did just that. So I began searching on [google](https://www.google.com/?safe=active&ssui=on) for different images I could use for each level. The first level has some type of minecraft underground theme, the next has a space theme because I really like space  travel, the third is a cafe because I was doing this work in a cafe and the fourth is a fiery type of feeling to represent a difficult ending. The next thing I did was add the platforms for each level and each level has its platforms designed differently as each level is going to have different difficulties. The first they will have to navigate a lot, the next they will have to defeat monsters, the third level has more searching and the fourth is going to have a boss. 

Now that I have added the platforms, the next thing that I will be attempting to do is going to be adding the difficulties for each level. I have some images in my head of what monsters and bosses will be added but they are still just ideas that I am unsure of and will give it more thought before fully committing to adding it to the game. 

## EDP

## EDP
In the [Engineering Design Process](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#edp) I am currently on step 5 which is **Creating a prototype**. The game I am currently working on will become my final game one day. I have developed a decent layout and have started a good beginning to keep on building off of. The next step of the engineering design process that I will be working on is **testing the prototype**. I will have to make sure that all the obstacles work as planned and that the player is actually able to win the game meaning there are no difficulties that make the game unwinnable. 

## Skills
The [skills](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#skills) I have worked on throughout the last few weeks have been **creativity** and **attention to detail**. To create these levels I had complete control over how I wanted it to look and I took advantage of it. I used that creative freedom and created something that I like while still maintaining an aesthetic look for the game. I've worked on the skill of paying attention to detail by making sure that the game still looked nice when the player was actually playing the game. I would preview the game whenever I made changes as the creators point of view is different from the players point of view so I had to make sure I was checking both to make sure everything was alright.
