From my last blog entry, I stated that I wanted to create a general layout for my platformer game. I have done that relatively well however there were a few things that I didn't get a chance to work on just yet and for good reason. One thing I wanted to work on from my last entry was getting my own sprites for my game however I was so focues on creating my general layout that I forgot to complete that task.

After some time and effort I ended up having the image show below as my first draft of my layout,

<img width="364" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-02 at 11 02 07â€¯PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1002cc7a-ff2f-48e4-9bfb-4320c01b65aa" />

Honestly, I am very satisfied with how the layout turned out. The way I made this was I first had to think about the design. I knew that if I made the different levels too lengthy horizontally, the game would become pretty confusing for the player because the camera is zoomed in on the character so it would become difficult for the player to naviagate. So to prevent this issue from happening I added walls to the levels and the way I did that was I realized that objects with the platform behavior, the player could jump and run on top of the object but when the player would come into contact with the object horizontally, they couldn't progress. 

So 

1) I added objects
2) added the platform behavior to them
3) increased the size of them
4) Added the sides of the objects to act as the walls for the game

So now the game had it's walls.

Now the next step would be to add the different levels. I was sitting with my friend and I asked him what level themes should I include. He said to think about things that I like, so I did just that. The first level has some type of minecraft underground theme, the next has a space theme because I really like space  travel, the third is a cafe because I was doing this work in a cafe and the forth is a firey type of feeling to represent a difficult ending. The next thing I did was add the platforms for each level and each level has it's platforms designed differently as each level is going to have different difficulties. The first they will have to navigate a lot, the next they will have to defeat monsters, the third level has more searching and the forth is going to have a boss. I added the platforms but next will be to add the difficulties.
