I have continued learning more about (GDevelop)[https://gdevelop.io/] and while it has become a little more difficult it has only become more enjoyable.

The first thing I learned was how to add a health bar to the players which is very similar to how I learned to add joysticks in the previous entry. The steps in order to do that is to make sure that your adding it to the interface layer, add a ready to use Object, look at the resource bars, pick one, add it to the scene. 

Now what is different from adding a joystick is that we have to connect it to the players health. (When I previewed the game before adding anything, whenever the player would hit anything, the player would take damege but I was confused how because I didn't add health to the player. Then I checked the behaviors for the player and realized that there was preadded behaviors such as `ARMOR`, `HEALTH CONFIGURATION`, `HEALTH REGENERATION`, and `SHIELD REGENERATION`. Realizing these are the behaviors I need to have to have for my player to have health (Don't need the shield in my game but I could add it if I want) ). To connect the health bar to the player, we needed to add an action to the health bar. We click on the Value, then we connect it to the value of where the health of the player is which can be found in the `Health points`, connect it to the player and then all is done. After this I tried the same process with other health bars getting used to the process of it however I still need much more to memorize it perfectly.  

Now that I have gotten a pretty good feel for GDevlop, I wanted to create a brand new project from scratch and see what I can do. So the first thing I did was create a blank project. Then I imported a full game asset pack just so that I could have options of what to add. I then added the player, some blocks, and the health bar so the screen looked like this
