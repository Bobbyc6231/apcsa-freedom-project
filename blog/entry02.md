## Content
I have continued learning more about (GDevelop)[https://gdevelop.io/] and while it has become a little more difficult it has only become more enjoyable.

### Leaning a little more
The first thing I learned was how to add a health bar to the players which is very similar to how I learned to add joysticks in the previous entry. The steps in order to do that is to make sure that your adding it to the interface layer, add a ready to use Object, look at the resource bars, pick one, add it to the scene. 

Now what is different from adding a joystick is that we have to connect it to the players health. (When I previewed the game before adding anything, whenever the player would hit anything, the player would take damege but I was confused how because I didn't add health to the player. Then I checked the behaviors for the player and realized that there was preadded behaviors such as `ARMOR`, `HEALTH CONFIGURATION`, `HEALTH REGENERATION`, and `SHIELD REGENERATION`. Realizing these are the behaviors I need to have to have for my player to have health (Don't need the shield in my game but I could add it if I want) ). To connect the health bar to the player, we needed to add an action to the health bar. We click on the Value, then we connect it to the value of where the health of the player is which can be found in the `Health points`, connect it to the player and then all is done. After this I tried the same process with other health bars getting used to the process of it however I still need much more to memorize it perfectly.  

### Creating my first draft project
Now that I have gotten a pretty good feel for GDevlop, I wanted to create a brand new project from scratch and see what I can do. So the first thing I did was create a blank project. Then I imported a full game asset pack just so that I could have options of what to add. I then added the player, some blocks, and the health bar so the screen looked like this,

 I the added some basic behaviors to the screen such as making the player movable and then adding it so that the platforms are walkable on and added some health to the player however I wasn't sure yet how to make it so that the player takes damage whenever they encounter a obsticle which is something that I plan on learning very soon.

### What I plan on doing now
Winter break is coming up soon and throughout it I plan to work on my first draft. I want to figure out how to add my own sprites that I can use, I also plan on figuring out the amount of different levels I want and just have a general idea of the layout that I want my final game to be like. For instance have the first level be themed fire, the next space, the one after, water and so on. These are just ideas so that very soon I can start the idea and then just keep on working towards it. 
 
## EDP
In the Engineering Design Process I am currently on steps 2 which is *research*, 3 which is *Brainstorming*, and 4 which is *Planning*. Throughout the past few weeks all of the leaning and tinkering was work towards me reseraching just few of the many things that GDevlop has to offer such as how to add healthbars and how to connect it to the player. I also am going to brainstorm what I want my final project to have as well as plan how I can make those brainstorming ideas into a reality.
