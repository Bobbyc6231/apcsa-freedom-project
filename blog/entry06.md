### Content
I have now completed presenting my project to my class as well as presenting in my school's Software Engineering Program Expo, which is where students in the Software Engineering Program present to judges, other students and teachers.

For my in class presentation, I felt very comfortable presenting to my peers. All of my peers that were watching me are good friends that I have built strong connections with throughout our years in the Software Engineering Program. I completed my [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NXGK1hCNqgL8OifrMw6qU4KLLWvWeY1lRx9OEqugvx8/edit?slide=id.g359f7e38fce_0_37489#slide=id.g359f7e38fce_0_37489) and because the slides were filled with information of how I made my game, I knew it very well. I realized that if you know the information that you are presenting, it is significantly easier to present. Something else that helped me present is practicing how I would present each slide while I was making them. Every slide that I made, I designed in a way that it was easiest for me to present. To make sure I didn't put too much text, I made sure that the words that were on the slide showed key words so that when I were to present and see the key words, I would know exactly what I was presenting.

For my Expo presentations, they were a bit quicker because it is supposed to be quick and fast so that the viewers have time to visit other projects. For every visiter, I had a video demonstration of gameplay to show the game. I wanted to be as human as possible so I didn't have a script planned out because I wanted these interactions to be as natural as possible. The way I wanted it to go, was when they walk up to my table and it is as if a stranger walks up to me in a cafe and we just start talking. Even though I didn't know the individuals as I did during my class presentation, I still felt calm presenting my project. I hope that in my future presentations, I will always see them as simply me interacting with strangers in hopes to have conversations with them. 


### EDP
In the Engineering Design Process, I have just completed the last step of Communicating the results. I have officially presented my platformer to dozens of individuals and it is something I am very proud about. Something that I am very happy about, is that I was able to bring smiles onto peoples faces with the game I made. Whether they were playing my game for themselves, or whether they were watching me present my game, I saw people laugh and smile. A teacher in my school gave links to her students of all the things that the seniors have made and asked me if I was the one who made the "Mr Mueller game", and when I told her yes, she explained that her students loved it. That feeling of being able to make people smile even if it was just for a few minutes was very rewarding. 

### Skills
One skill I've worked on was communication. I communicated my project to others and was able to finally show off the hard work that I've put into this project throughout the year. This project to me was a true example of how hard work does pay off eventually as the results do not come easy. Throughout this entire project, the biggest skill I've practiced has been creativity. The entire concept of a platformer is already known meaning that individuals who have played platformers might see another platformer as repetitive, however using my creativity, I made a game where most of the people didn't see repetitiveness, but instead saw joy.
