### Content
Since my last blog entry, I have added some more to the game which contribute a lot to the enjoyment of the game. The first thing I wanted to do was work on the game one level at a time so I worked on level one. The platforms that I wanted to have in the first level was already done and now I wanted to add the fruit to be collected. I wasn't sure how to make it so that the player could collect an item so I searched it up on [google](https://www.google.com/?safe=active&ssui=on) and found this [tutorial](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/tutorials/platformer/part-5/). I followed the steps and was able to add the fruit, make it so that when the player collides with the fruit it disappears, and learn how to keep track of the amount of items that is collected.

(Before item is collected)

(After item is collected)

To do that I had to add an event and action to the scene which is the same as adding a conditional, if the event occurs, then the action will happen.

I also had to create a variable to hold the value of the amount of fruits collected.

I began getting used to the process of adding events and actions to the scene so much so that I was able to add the orange to the next level (including it being deleted when the player interacts with it and it increasing the variable that is holding the amount of fruits collected) without looking at any tutorials. 


The last thing I did was add the enemies and added some movement to them to the second level. To do this I followed this [tutorial](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/tutorials/platformer/part-6/). It included more events and actions (conditionals),

(The events and actions)

(The enemies in the second level)

Now I will be working on trying to add health to the enemies and make it so that the player can somehow do damage to the enemies and that the enemies can do damage to the player. I will try to make it so that the player has three hit points meaning they can only be hit three times before having to restart. I will try to make it so that the player has a blaster that can be used to destroy the enemies. 

### EDP

In the [Engineering Design Process](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#edp) I am currently on step 5 *creating the prototype* and step 6 *testing the prototype*. I am still creating and working on the game adding the components such as the fruits to be collected and obstacles for the player to get past. I am also making sure that everything that I add works as planned and that no technical difficulties arrive when the player plays the game. 

### Skills

The [skills](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#skills) that I have practiced throughout the last few weeks have been *how to read* and *logical reasoning*. To figure out how to add the components of the fruits and the movement of the enemies, I had to read different documentations to learn what events and actions to add in order to complete the tasks. I have also worked on logical reasoning as a lot of what I've worked on over the past few weeks have been conditionals which is practicing that if something happens in my game, something else will be caused. For instance if the enemy hits a specific object, it will go the opposite way or if the player hits the fruit, it will disappear.
