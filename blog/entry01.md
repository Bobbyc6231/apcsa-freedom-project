## Content 
This is the beginning of the process of me creating my freedom project. The goal is to make a platformer game where the user has to go up different levels and as the user gets higher the game gets harder. A tool that I will be using to help me make this game is called [GDevelop](https://gdevelop.io/). It is a game engine which can help someone make 2d, 3d, and multiplayer games.

The first thing I had to do was download the app. At first it was pretty overwhelming because it did seem to have quite the amount of aspects to it. There were buttons, words, and I had no clue what any of them meant or did. I first looked at all the different types of projects that were pre-made and I liked how they allowed me to switch up the small things to see what I could make. FOr example there was a game where a character was running to collect coins, and I could change the character or the obstacles but the goal to collect coins stayed the same.

I then began looking at the tutorials that were there to teach us how to add some basic stuff for games. The first tutorial I looked at was how to add behaviors to an object. There were obstacles already in place but the character couldn't move, so they taught me how to add an event to a character object. The next tutorial I looked at was how to make pixel perfect movements for a player which was just a different type of event. Both of these tutorials showed me that there are going to be plenty of different events that I could use. I just have to realize which ones are going to be the one I need for the specific actions that I want.

One last tutorial that I looked at was how to add a joystick. However there was something up with the app that wasn't allowing me to follow the tutorial so I searched about this issue on this [platform](https://forum.gdevelop.io/t/i-cant-drag-and-place-objects/27920) where people can share information and experiences about GDevelop. They said they had similar errors so I decided to just start using the website for GDevelop and that worked fine. I made a list of the steps of how to add a joystick shown below,

1) You have to change the layer to be interface so the user can use it
2) Add a new object
3) Click the prefabs (Ready to use objects)
4) Click the multitouch Joysticks
5) Click one
6) Add it to the scene
7) Drag the joystick object onto the screen
8) Click the object that you want the joystick to control
9) Click Edit behavior
10) Add the TopDownMultitouchMapper behavior
11) Look at controls, switch the Stick mode to 360ยบ and apply

Overall I have gotten a pretty good start to learning about GDevelop and the next thing that I need to practice is the process of adding different components and events to games.

## EDP

In the [Engineering Design Process](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#edp), I am currently on the steps of **research** and **brainstorming**. I am researching and learning how to use GDevelop and expose myself to what this game engine can do. It has gone pretty well so far but there is still so much to explore. I am also looking at the components of what is provided and brainstorming what I can incorporate with my future Freedom Project.

## Skills
For this first blog entry, I have practiced the [skills](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#skills) of **How to learn** as well as **time management**. I've never heard of GDevelop before and I have been practicing how to learn as I am trying to process what GDevelop is and become adjusted to their concepts. I am practicing time management as I have been on top of working on this project when I am supposed to be and have been making progress little by little.
