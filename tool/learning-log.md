* The fist thig I had to do was download G Devlop (I actually love the fact that this tool is a app because I get to store everything I make on it)
* At first it seemed pretty overwhelming, there was a lot of buttons and words everywhere not knowing what any of it does
* I took a look at all of the different projects that were pre made and they were really cool because it allowed you to switch up the small things but the concepts stayed the same(Ex. A game where a character was running to collect coins, we could change the character or the obsticle but the goal to collect coins stayed the same)

### 10/20/2024:
* I began looking at the tutorials that they had to teach us how to add the basics of a game
* The first tutorial was how to add behaviors to an object (In the first example the obsticles were already in place however the character couldn't move, so we would have to click the charcter object, and add an event)
* The next tutorial was for how to make pixal perfect movements for a player (This is the same thing as the first tutorial but just a different behavior)
* Both of these tutorials showed me that there is going to be plenty of different functions that I could use I just have to realize which ones are going to be the one I need for the specific actions that I want
* The Third Tutorial talked about adding behaviors then adding actions to the behavior, not exactly sure what that does and definetly goning to need more practice with that to gain a better understanding of adding actions

### 10/27/2024:
* I learned how to add a joystick for mobile players however there was an issue with the app. With the G Develop App, I tried to drag the joystick onto the game and it wasn't working. I tried to check on [gdevlop.io](https://forum.gdevelop.io/t/i-cant-drag-and-place-objects/27920) a place for people to discuss things about GDevelop and people had the same issues. I then tried the GDevelop browser and it worked fine. To avoid future issues I think I will just stick to using the browser
  
* To add a Joystick
1) You have to change the layer to be interface so the user can use it
2) Add a new object
3) Click the prefabs (Ready to use objects)
4) Click the multitouch Joysticks
5) Click one
6) Add it to the scene
7) Drag the joystick object onto the screen
8) Click the object that you want the joystick to control
9) Click Edit behavior
10) Add the TopDownMultitouchMapper behavior
11) Look at controls, switch the Stick mode to 360ยบ and apply

* I learned how to add 3d platforms for a 2d platformer

1) Grab or create a 3d box platform
2) edit the platform by adding a behavior
3) Add platform as the behavior which makes the object act as a platform for the user to run on
4) Then add the platform to the game

* The next thing that I need to practice is how to create my own objects and own platforms
