### 10/14/2024:
* The first thing I had to do was download G Devlop (I actually love the fact that this tool is a app because I get to store everything I make on it)
* At first it seemed pretty overwhelming, there was a lot of buttons and words everywhere not knowing what any of it does
* I took a look at all of the different projects that were pre made and they were really cool because it allowed you to switch up the small things but the concepts stayed the same(Ex. A game where a character was running to collect coins, we could change the character or the obsticle but the goal to collect coins stayed the same)

### 10/20/2024:
* I began looking at the tutorials that they had to teach us how to add the basics of a game
* The first tutorial was how to add behaviors to an object (In the first example the obsticles were already in place however the character couldn't move, so we would have to click the charcter object, and add an event)
* The next tutorial was for how to make pixal perfect movements for a player (This is the same thing as the first tutorial but just a different behavior)
* Both of these tutorials showed me that there is going to be plenty of different functions that I could use I just have to realize which ones are going to be the one I need for the specific actions that I want
* The Third Tutorial talked about adding behaviors then adding actions to the behavior, not exactly sure what that does and definetly goning to need more practice with that to gain a better understanding of adding actions

### 10/27/2024:
* I learned how to add a joystick for mobile players however there was an issue with the app. With the G Develop App, I tried to drag the joystick onto the game and it wasn't working. I tried to check on [gdevlop.io](https://forum.gdevelop.io/t/i-cant-drag-and-place-objects/27920) a place for people to discuss things about GDevelop and people had the same issues. I then tried the GDevelop browser and it worked fine. To avoid future issues I think I will just stick to using the browser
  
* To add a Joystick
1) You have to change the layer to be interface so the user can use it
2) Add a new object
3) Click the prefabs (Ready to use objects)
4) Click the multitouch Joysticks
5) Click one
6) Add it to the scene
7) Drag the joystick object onto the screen
8) Click the object that you want the joystick to control
9) Click Edit behavior
10) Add the TopDownMultitouchMapper behavior
11) Look at controls, switch the Stick mode to 360º and apply

* I learned how to add 3d platforms for a 2d platformer

1) Grab or create a 3d box platform
2) edit the platform by adding a behavior
3) Add platform as the behavior which makes the object act as a platform for the user to run on
4) Then add the platform to the game

* The next thing that I need to practice is how to create my own objects and own platforms

### 11/18/2024

* I learrned how to add health bars to characters
* I tried to input different types of healthbars
* It is just another premade thing just like a joystick
* Learned multiplayer is just another behavior
  * every characters host is different
* Learned how to add texts and how you can add behaviors to it
* Also discoved BB Text and Bitmap text

### 12/02/024

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxeD_2nTyHI, This youtube link really simplified the concepts of GDevlop
  * Some ideas might be
    * A space person going up because the space theme is easy to design
    * Another minecraft game
   
* Created my first ever project
* Added over 100 premade objects
* Added specific behaviors to player and the platforms
* Need to figure out how to add it so that the player follows the platforms shape
* Added healthbar to the scene

* Added more obsticles and characteristics to scene
* Watched this video how to add my own background
  * [Background tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u77YiWi338U)
  * Added my own image as a sprite and added it to the ground
* Added multiple different backgrounds to make a mash up of different images

* Completely changed the entirety of the backgrounds because it seemed unorganized
* Now that I have the platforms laid out the next step is to add the obsticles
  * Monsters that have weapons
  * Monsters that chace you
  * Stationary weapons that can harm you if you touch them

### 02/24/2025
 * I used this [link](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/extensions/fire-bullet/details/?utm_source=gdevelop&utm_medium=help-link) to figure out how to add a item to the scene
 * I also figured out how to make it so that when the player collides with the item, the item disapears
 * Created a score to keep track of the amount of items that is collected

(Before item is colleceted)

### 03/03/2025
* I have now gotten used with the proces of adding events to the scene so much so that I was able to add the orange to the next level (including it being deleted when the player interacts with it) without looking at any tutorials
