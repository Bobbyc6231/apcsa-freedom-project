# APCSA Freedom Project
by **Bobby Chan**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for AP Computer Science A is a year-long project all about making anything using technology.

For my project, I chose to independently study **[GDevelop](https://gdevelop.io/)** in order to help me make **A platformer game where a character must avoid enemies while collecting fruits in order to win**.

## Implications

##### PROS
* It creates an environment where individuals are together jointly trying to have fun
* Others can take a break from stressful environments and play my game
* Individuals can take inspiration from my game to create their own games in which can lead to future careers in game development
* No physical waste is produced by the game
* Improves players reflexes
  
##### CONS
* Games can become addictive and can lead to people spending too much time playing
* The game is more on the difficult side to win leading to frustration
* The hitboxes for when the player hits the enemy could be seen as unreasonable
